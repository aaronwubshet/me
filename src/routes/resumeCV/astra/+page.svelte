<h2>Product Management & Strategy </h2>
<p>
  Between my 2nd and 3rd year at Bain, I took a 5 month secondament/externship to work in a product management / strategy role 
  at a satellite launch company called Astra. While my initial role there was focused on building out a strategy for future
  constellations in the form of satellites as a service, I quickly pivoted to focusing on potential physical space products. I was 
  there for 5 months and got to touch a little bit of everything from optimizing launch costs to defining customer needs in the 
  emerging space products division at Astra. I was able to conduct customer calls, developing a pricing model, and build out a 
  constellation market map tool to support evolving market size questions. All of these activities required putting in place work
  flows that would outlast me and required input from multiple stakeholders including Product, Finance, and Sales. Ultimately, I was able 
  to share a significant portion of the existing space products pricing work as well as new space product business plan development 
  work with both the CTO and CEO at multiple points throughout my 5 months.
