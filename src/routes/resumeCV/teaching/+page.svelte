<h1>Teaching</h1>

<h2>As an undergraduate student I enjoyed the opportunity to work with other students on courses I'd already completed to pass down helpful knowledge, problem solve / debug their assignments and projects along side them, and grade assignments. This helped keep the relevant knowledge fresh in my mind and my skills sharp.</h2>
