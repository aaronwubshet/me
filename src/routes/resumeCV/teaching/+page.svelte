<h1>Teaching</h1>

<h3>As an undergraduate student I enjoyed the opportunity to work with other students on courses I'd already completed to pass down helpful knowledge, problem solve / debug their assignments and projects along side them, and grade assignments. This helped keep the relevant knowledge fresh in my mind and my skills sharp. I was able to work on a wide range of courses throughout my time at MIT including:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Feedback Control Systems</li>
  <li>Digital Systems Laboratory</li>
  <li>Introduction to MatLab</li>
  <li>Applications of Circuits & Electronics</li>
  <li>Signals and Systems</li>
  <li>Circuits and Electronics</li>
  <li>Physics II: Electricity and Magnetism</li>
</ul>
