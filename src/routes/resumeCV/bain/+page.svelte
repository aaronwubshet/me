    <h2> Consultant</h2>
    <p>
      The Consultant position at Bain is a ~2-3 year program (through Manager) aiming to create the next set of senior managers that can lead teams of 4-6 people. I was promoted to Consultant ~6 months ahead of schedule and had the opportunity to work with an aerospace and defense client to define their 3rd party MRO strategy. This short sprint gave me the opportunity to quickly learn a wide range of information about different components and the intricacies of the secondary repair market for each. I completed this work right before leaving for my MBA at Sloan.

    <h2>(Senior) Associate Consultant</h2>
    <p>
      The Associate Consultant role at Bain is a 2-3 year (through Senior Associate Consultant) program geared at recent graduates. During the course of the two years I had the opportunity to work on a variety of cases and clients ranging from private equity to consumer products to aerospace and defense manufacturing. I was able to spearheaded financial modeling and market research (survey based and market participant interview based) workflows while managing multiple direct reports as part of conducting company or industry due diligence primarily in healthcare IT. For the aerospace and defense manufacturer, I  owned a significant piece of supply chain analysis that helped identify opportunities to optimize working capital and reduce delivery delays in addition to helping stand up a cost visibility PMO. After returning from a 5 month externship, I spent some time working with an IT services firm on procurement spend rationalization by identifying cost saving opportunities as well as helping the clients consistently execute and build a culture around collaborating across their large organization in order to leverage their scale in negotiations.

    <h2>Associate Consulting Internship (ACI)</h2>
    <p>
      As an ACI with Bain, I worked on a cost reduction and restructuring effort at a large industrial plant. Opportunities to drive my own workstream and explore possible avenues of adding value for the client grew as I became more comfortable in my role within the team. I took on the task of handling the extremely quantitative portions of the work enacting a lot of common business sense principals backed up by concrete mathematical foundations in order to uncover inefficiencies thus optimize the plant's performance. I was even allowed to lead interviews of clients to extract the nuances that only the plant's employees would be familiar with. I was also in charge of planning team outings to help foster a positive team environment.

    <h2 id="BEL">Building Entrepreneurial Leaders (BEL) </h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.bain.com/careers/bel/">The BEL program </a> is Bain's weeklong crash course introduction in management consulting geared toward underrepresented minorities. After a few days of training via countless information sessions, we were dropped into existing case teams to contribute as much as possible in the final 48-72 hours. The fast paced nature of the work meant that despite the short time frame, there was plenty of opportunity to add value. The case I was part of was working with a client that was looking to stand up a corporate venture capital division to nurture and harness potential industry disrupting technologies. I was tasked with building a qualitative profile along with a quantitative score card for potential leaders of the new division.
