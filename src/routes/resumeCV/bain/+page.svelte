            <p>
              The Consultant role at Bain is a ~2-3 year program (through Manager) aiming to create the next set of senior managers that 
              can lead teams of typcially 4-6. I was promoted to Consultant ~6 months ahead of schedule and had the opporutnity to work with an 
              aerospace and defense client to define their 3rd party MRO strategy. This short sprint gave me the opportunity to quickly learn a 
              wide range of information about different components and the intracies of the secondary repair market for each. I completed this 
              work right before leaving for my MBA at Sloan.

            <h2>Associate Consultant</h2>
            <p>
              The Associate Consultant role at Bain is a 2-3 year (through Senior Associate Consultant) program geared at new grads.
              During the course of the two years I had the opportunity to work on a variety of cases and clients ranging
              from private equity to consumer products to aerospace and defense manufacturering. I was able to
              spearheaded financial modeling and market research (survey based and market participant interview based)
              workflows while managing 1-2 people as part of conducting company or industry due diligence primarily in
              healthcare IT. For the aerospace and defense manufacturer, I  owned a significant piece of supply chain analysis that helped 
              identify opportunities to optimize working capital and reduce delivery delays in addition to helping stand up a cost visibility PMO. 
              After returing from a 5 month externship, I spent some time working with an IT services firm on procurement spend rationalization by
              identifying cost saving opportunities as well as helping the clients consistently execute and build a culture around collaborating across their large
              organization in order to leverage their scale in negotiations.

            <h2>Associate Consulting Internship (ACI)</h2>
            <p>
              As an ACI with Bain, I was further exposed to management consulting through a different client, this time
              working on a cost reduction and restructuring effort at a large industrial plant. Opportunities to drive
              my own workstream and explore possible avenues of adding value for the client grew as I became more
              comfortable in my role within the team. I took on the task of handling the extremely quantitative portions
              of the work enacting a lot of common business sense principals backed up by concrete mathematical
              foundations in order to uncover inefficiencies thus optimize the plant's performance. I was even allowed
              to lead interviews of clients to extract the nuances that only the plant's employees would be familiar
              with. I was also in charge of planning team outings to help foster a positive team environment. This was accomplished
              with a combination of nice meals as well as a fun night out playing laser tag.

            <h2>Building Entrepreneurial Leaders (BEL) </h2>
            <p>
              <a href="https://www.bain.com/careers/bel/">The BEL program </a> is Bain's weeklong crash course introduction in management consulting geared toward
              minorities. After a few days of training via countless information sessions, we were dropped into existing
              case teams to contribute as much as possible in the final 48-72 hours. The fast paced nature of the work
              meant that despite the short time frame, there was plenty of opportunity to add value. The case I was part of was working with a client that was
              looking to stand up a corporate venture capital division to nurture and harness potential industry
              disrupting technologies. I was tasked with building a qualitative profile along with a quantitative score
              card for potential leaders of the new division.
