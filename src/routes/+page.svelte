<h1>Aaron Wubshet: UNDER CONSTRUCTION BROWSE AT YOUR OWN RISK</h1>
<h2>The basics and more </h2>
<p> Welcome to my drawing board / dumping ground / portfolio of past projects and experiences! If you've found yourself here then you probably know who I am, but if you don't, my name is Aaron. I will be your host for this journey through my (mostly) professional life. But first a few quick facts...<p>
	<b>Family</b> - My parents immigrated to the US from Ethiopia before I was born in the northern Virginia / DC area. We soon moved the suburbs outside Atlanta where I grew up and my younger sister was born.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Learning</b> - I went to a STEM focused high school called GSMST before heading off to
	Boston to
	go to MIT for undergraduate and eventually my masters of engineering, both in electrical
	engineering. I continue to enjoy learning new things both related to engineering and in
	other domains. I am returning to MIT Sloan Summer 2023 as part of the LGO program where I 
	will complete a dual degree program in Business (MBA) and Electrical Engineering (MS).
</p>
<p>
	<b>Hobbies / interests</b> - There are a few core activities that have always been part of
	what I
	like to use my free time like writing poetry and playing / watching basketball. However,
	I've expanded my horizon of activities in recent years to a wide array of things from
	watching anime to cooking and baking to learning how to play guitar or tennis or chess. I've
	even found some time to get back into playing (in addition to streaming!) video games 
	as well as learning more about photography.
</p>
<p> As we jump into more detail about all things Aaron, I want to highlight the primary use case
	of this site as simply exploring a few past projects and the resulting key skillsets I
	gained as a result. My resume can also give you a quick flavor of my experiences and
	skillset and is linked below. And if you want to chat, fill out the contact me form and 
	I'll get back to you!
